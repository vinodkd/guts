Grand Unified Theory of Software
================================

My attempt at defining an algebra or physics for software.

The idea is to define software as "structures" made up of blocks such as statements, functions, methods, classes, modules and so forth; then assess the impact of things such as load, new requirements (and the associated scope creep) and so forth as "forces" acting on these structures.

Current Status
==============
A swirling vortex of vague ideas dumped into a Freemind mindmap. Expected to be in this half-baked state for a while.

Milestones
==========
1. Define Structural Stability for all levels upto application
