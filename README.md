Grand Unified Theory of Software
================================

GUTS is my attempt at creating a "natural" theory for software much like physics does for the real world. The big ideas are to:

- define the properties of software in terms of building blocks such as the atomic statment and datum;
- build up towards larger and more complex structures such as modules, components, applications and ecosystems; 
- model their structure as analogues of phsyical constructs and the behavior as dynamic systems.
- use these models to predict software stability, flexibility etc.

End goal
========

The output is (a hopefully useful) theory that can be used to answer questions like:


- Is this piece of software stable? Flexible? Brittle?
- Can I define how complex a system is based on its code?
- how can I use this to develop a plan to understand it?
- if I change X, what will happen to the software?
- How much change of X can the software take before it breaks?
- What is the cost of changing X?
- How did it reach its current state of stability/flexibility/brittleness?


Current Status
==============

My current state of thought is captured in a Freemind Mindmap

This is available in two formats:


- A [Flash enabled one](http://vinodkd.github.com/guts/out/full/guts.html) that's closest to the Freemind experience.
- A (non-flash, clickable image map version)[http://vinodkd.github.com/guts/out/basic/guts.html] that has all the content but is not as directly accessible as the previous one; but works on iPads and such like

Milestones
==========
1. Define Structural Stability for all levels upto application - TBD
