** Sep-07-2013 18:55 : ** Need to reorg dir structure to:

		guts/
			MASTER:
				README.md
				ref/
				src/
					mmap/
						guts.mm
					book/
						01_size.md
						jpg files
				tools/
					readme2index.sh   -- writes out any change to readme as index.html on web/out
					book2html.sh      -- writes out any change to the book onto web/out
					publish.sh        -- copies web/out over to gh-pages
					toHTML.js
					node_modules/				
				web/
					partial/
						book.top.html
						book.bot.html
						index.top.html
						index.bot.html
					css/
						guts.css
					out/   -- this is the source for gh-pages that is generated by the tools.
						index.html
						mmap/
						book/
							01_size.html
			GH-PAGES
				index.html
				mmap/       -- these are the only dirs that will be directly updated in gh-pages. because its pointless to do it in master. 
					        -- Freemind doesnt have a command line option.
					full/
					basic/
				book/

this requires:

* DONE move src to top
* DONE move book under src
* DONE move files in src to book
* DONE create src/mmap and move guts.mm there
* DONE rename toHtml.sh to book2html.sh
* DONEcreate readme2index.sh to convert readme.md into index.html
	- DONE create index.top.html from current gh-pages version
	- DONE create index.bot.html
* DONE create web, web/partial
* DONE mv html/top.html and bot.html to web/partial/book.top.html and bot.html resp
* DONE mv html/guts.css to web/css/guts.css
* DONE delete book/html
* DONE change book2html to use the right directories
* DONE move gh-pages/out to gh-pages/mmap
* DONE create gh-pages/book
* DONE fixed refs to the mmap in readme.md so that when its published, it will refer to the right location.
* create publish.sh that will copy web/out to gh-pages

** Sep-07-2013 19:50 : ** Used http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/ for help on gh-pages workflow. esp, how to checkout a file from a different branch.
