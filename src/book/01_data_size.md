Sizing up data
--------------

All this while we've been talking about the operations and pretty much ignored the data that programs are typically associated with. In fact the SSI section had a few variables and I glossed over them on purpose because it was relatively easy to deal with operations by themselves. Now that we have a handle on the operations, however, its time to go back and give data its due.

### What is Data?

First of all, what is data? To go back to the Marble run visualization, data is what flows through the blocks and exercises them. It makes the wheels turn and the flip-flop flip (or flop). It is what uses the code. Some of it is input, some is generated by the program itself while it executes and some is output. Static languages pre-allocate some data for efficiency and allocate the rest while running; dynamic languages allocate most of their data during execution. As a definition, therefore:

> Data: Pieces of information used by code.

### Kinds of data
constants vs variables, scalar vs non-scalar, 

Datum: the smallest piece of information the language allows
Link: A connection between two pieces of data
List: An ordered collection of data
Set: An unordered colleciton of data
Tree: A hierarchy of data
Graph: A generally assocated set of data

### Fundamental difference between "abstract" data and its representation in a VnM machine

Finite storage => finite size.

### Sizes of basic data types

Datum: 1 unit
Link: 1 unit x w width
List: n units
Set : n units
Tree: 

TODO: TALK ABOUT DATA SIZE BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC.
CIRCLE BACK TO HOW CODE SIZE IS DATA SIZE AND VV BCOS CODE SIZE IS MEASURING THE SIZE OF A GRAPH DATA STRUCTURE.
