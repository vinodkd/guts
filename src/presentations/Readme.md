How I made the video
--------------------
- Start up quicktime
- Start a movie recording session. This brings up a window to record my face using the webcam
- Then start a screen recording session. This allows recording the screen at the same time.
	- choose to record sound as well by pressing the little triangle.
- Using this sequence, I could record both the screen and me in an inset. However, I didnt use this because editing it was not easy. Instead I just ended up overlaying the videos in iMovie.
- once all videos are recorded, create a new movie project in iMovie. 
- Import videos one by one because iMovie expands them out and selecting them is not easy. Just add one video at a time.
- pull each video into the timeline and play to review what it looks like.
- When satisfied, choose Share -> File to save as mp4, or Share -> vimeo to upload.
- Since I uploaded once and then replaced, I did the share to vimeo once and then did the save to file to multiple times.
- Creating the file takes a long time and full CPU.
- Once uploaded (which takes about the same time), vimeo takes about 30-45 mins to transcode it/whatever. So if there's a deadline, plan ahead.

Video Filming tips
------------------
- do not detail out the screenplay like in the fpw_screenplay.md.
- instead decide on the broad segments - exactly like the agenda of a ppt.
- film each segment and join them up in iMovie.
- Film the segments with facetime during the day. Film the screen recording segments whenever.
- Watch out for continuity issues. Eg, since i filmed the conclusion first i talk about using 15 mins, but overall the video took more than 20.
